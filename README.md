# 👋 Hi, I'm Reena!
### 🎓 Second-year at San Jose State University, majoring in Computer Science
### 🔭 Aspiring Machine Learning and Software Engineer

I have a passion for innovation and enjoy tackling relevant and valuable real-world problems. As a strong and reliable team player, I’m a conscientious individual who ensures that my team achieves success through my work and dedication as a responsible leader. I value growth, being able to continuously build my skills as I explore my field of interest, and learning from industry professionals.

Holding a certificate in Machine Learning Foundations from Cornell Tech, I’m currently working with **Anote AI** on a project about synthetic data generation using machine learning tools with the goal of supporting various computer vision models. My major coursework includes Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems, and Object-Oriented Design, from which I’ve developed strong technical and problem solving skills. 

I’m actively looking for internship opportunities to grow as a software/ML engineer, expand my skills, and contribute to meaningful tech innovations. If you’re working on something exciting or think I’d be a good fit for your team, let me know!
